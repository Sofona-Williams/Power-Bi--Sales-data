## üìä Dashboard Overview
The dashboard is structured with several interconnected visualizations, each offering unique insights:
---
### üìà Total Sales by Category
- Visualization: Stacked Bar Chart
- Insight: Displays the total sales segmented by categories (Technology, Office Supplies, Furniture) and by customer segments (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office). This helps in understanding which categories perform best across different customer types.

### üí∞ Sum of Profit by Country
- Visualization: Choropleth Map (Europe focused)
- Insight: Visualizes the sum of profit across various European countries (e.g., Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands). This allows for quick identification of high-profit and low-profit geographical areas.

### üìä Sum of Sales and Sum of Profit by Year
- Visualization: Dual-Axis Line Chart
- Insight: Tracks the trends of both total sales and total profit over the years (from 2011 to 2014). This helps in observing the growth trajectory of sales and profit and identifying any divergences or correlations between them.

üì¶ Sum of lon by Ship Date
- Visualization: Bar Chart (Time Series)
- Insight: Appears to show a time series of a metric (labeled "Sum of lon" which might represent 'Longitude' or another unlabelled metric, possibly related to shipping or location-based data) across different ship dates (from 2011 to 2015). This could indicate patterns or anomalies related to shipping activities over time.
